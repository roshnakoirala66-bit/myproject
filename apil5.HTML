"My Experience in Dashain, Tihar, and Chhath Vacation"

The Dashain, Tihar, and Chhath vacation was a wonderful time filled with joy, celebration, and togetherness. These festivals are some of the most important in our culture, and I was excited to spend quality time with my family and friends during this break.

"Dashain" is the biggest festival in Nepal, and it was full of happiness. I visited my grandparents in the village, where we celebrated with tika, jamara, and blessings. I received tika and money from my elders, which made me feel loved and respected. We also flew kites, played cards, and enjoyed delicious food like goat meat and sel roti. The best part was spending time with all my cousins.

"Tihar", also known as the festival of lights, was colorful and beautiful. We lit candles and diyas every night, and our house looked amazing. I especially enjoyed "Bhai Tika", where my sister put tika on my forehead and prayed for my long life. We exchanged gifts and sweets. Playing Deusi-Bhailo with my friends was so much fun—we danced, sang, and collected money and snacks.

After Tihar, we celebrated "Chhath", which is mainly observed in the Terai region. I helped my mother prepare prasad like thekua and fruits. We went to the riverbank for the evening and morning arghya. Watching people worship the setting and rising sun with such devotion was inspiring. It felt peaceful and spiritual.

Overall, this vacation gave me unforgettable memories. I learned the importance of culture, tradition, and spending time with loved ones. I’m already looking forward to next year's celebrations.
