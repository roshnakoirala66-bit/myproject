<H1>"Tihar", also known as "Deepawali" or the "Festival of Lights", is one of the most important and vibrant Hindu festivals celebrated in Nepal and some parts of India. It usually falls in October or November and lasts for five days. Each day of Tihar is dedicated to honoring different animals, gods, and family relationships. The festival begins with "Kaag Tihar' (crow worship), followed by "Kukur Tihar' (dog worship), "Gai Tihar" and 'Laxmi Puja" (cow and goddess Laxmi worship), "Gobardhan Puja" (ox worship), and ends with "Bhai Tika", where sisters put a special tika on their brothers' foreheads, praying for their long life and prosperity. Homes are decorated with oil lamps, candles, and colorful rangoli designs. Tihar is a time of joy, family gatherings, and devotion, bringing light and happiness into everyone's lives.
