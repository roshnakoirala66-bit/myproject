    "Chhath" is a significant Hindu festival dedicated to the Sun God ("Surya") and his consort 
    "Chhathi Maiya", celebrated mainly in the Indian states of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, 
    and parts of Nepal. It usually takes place a few days after Diwali and lasts for four days. 
    Devotees observe rigorous rituals, including fasting, holy bathing in rivers, and offering 
    prayers to the setting and rising sun. Women play a central role in the festival, often 
    standing in water for long periods while making offerings. Chhath is marked by its spiritual 
    purity, discipline, and deep connection to nature, especially the sun, which is seen as the 
    source of all energy and life.
